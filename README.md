# Kottans Frontend Tasks
## Git and GitHub

Ok, I finally got familiar with Git basics. I heard about it for few years, but used for 0 years. Well, I used git clone, git init. Since last month had used commit, push and pull, but never understood how it really works. Course from Udacity, though looked too long for such topic, helped me to understand commits, branching, collaboration via forking and pull requests. Finally helped me to understand that there exists such thing as stage area and why it exists :) 

Reflections writing during the course helped to even strengthen the understanding. It's like preparing answers for the interview, but it's you who interviews youreself! Useful thing, shortly.

I also, wish that lections for the couse were even more interective and maybe had animations for different concepts, which really helps me to understand the material – _see how it work, moves visually_.

## Linux, Command Line, HTTP Tools

After Udacity's courese I got knowledge about combining command options, like -alt; work of cp command, and its ability to work with multiple files, and choose files to copy with wildcards. Now I also know that move (mv) can be used to rename files. I got knowledge about input/output, rewriting and appending to files, piping with "|", commands sort, uniq and grep (wow, we can search matches in files from commandline). Also I learned sed command and it's usage for outputing results with "filter". I also learned nano text editor; how to setup aliases and variables in .bash_profile; environment variables that contain info about environment.

> Ok, i'm writing this as I watch tutors (not afterwards) and I'm gonna admit, after being spoiled with cool and practice-centered Undacity and Codecademy courses, two long Tutsplus articles are boring, have hard to understand language and generally leave nothing new on this theme in my brain. They're just a long list of technologies and their definitions (as for me). Meh. So I'll try Udacity's "Networking for Web Developers" to better understend the theme.

Ok, so Udacity’s course on Networking gave me a better understanding of work of IP, TCP and HTTP layers of network structure. I finally understand what "subnet mask" on my router means, how people are dealing with running out of ipv4s and that HTTP is just a dialogue between browser and server with magic words, handled by TCP. Each layer from Hardware>IP>TCP>HTTP gives guarantees and simple interface of control for the other layer. I’ve got familiar with cool abilities of tcpdump to catch the packages. Knowledge about how routers control speed of receiving of data or how sites deal with distiguishing many users with the same public ip address, these are also very interesting.
