Ok, I finally got familiar with Git basics. I heard about it for few years, but used for 0 years. Well, I used git clone, git init. Since last month used commit, push and pull, but never understood how it really works. Course from Udacity, though looked too long for such topic, helped me to understand commits, branching, collaboration via forking and pull requests. Finally helped me to understand that there exists such thing as stage area and why it exists :) 

Reflections writing during the course helped to even strengthen the understanding. It's like preparing answers for the interview, but it's you who interviews youreself! Useful thing, shortly.

I also, wish that lections for the couse were even more interective and maybe had animations for different concepts, which really helps me to understand the material – _see how it work, moves visually_.
